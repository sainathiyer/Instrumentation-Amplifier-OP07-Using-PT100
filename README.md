# Instrumentation-Amplifier-OP07-Using-PT100
The PT100 is a resistance temperature detector (RTD) which changes its resistance depending on its surrounding temperature, it's used widely for industrial processes with slow dynamics and relatively wide temperature ranges. It's used for slow dynamic processes because RTDs have slow response times but are accurate and have low drift over time. The main objective of this project is to make this sensor work for a temperature range of 0 to 600 degrees Celsius. To achieve that we have calculated the specific resistances to get the desired gain.
